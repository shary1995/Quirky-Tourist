            <p>Traveling is all about exploring new places, cultures, cuisines, rituals and styles of living. We also travel because distance and difference are the secret toxic of learning and creativity which one cannot observe by sitting at home. Traveling in itself has advantages, as it makes one forget his or her worries, problems, frustrations and fears. This helps by broadening your horizon to move in new directions, unplugging from the pulls and pushes of daily life. At Quirky Tourist we make your dreams come true! We offer a range of guided tours worldwide, exploring the most beautiful and cultural cities in the world and incredible landscapes, driving through valleys, rivers, lakes and walking through forests and canyons to enjoy the extraordinary landscapes the world has to offer.</p>
            <p>Finding the eluded Work-Life Balance is almost impossible in today’s workforce so leaving all the stressors behind and boarding a plane to a land far, far, away or boarding a cruise liner to a destination where cool breezes frolic through the trees and warm waves rush unto the shore to greet you can be so relaxing. We have a passport to fill full of stamps rather  than to have a house full of stuff. Let’s use this to make memories all over the world..</p>
